Before We start we will take a look at [Cron Jobs](./LESSON0.md) That might help us in shell scripting.
# Node Shell Workshop

A tutorial that takes you through the basics of doing shell scripting with node.js. It culminates in a project using the lessons learned to build a small command-line tool.

See [LESSON1.md](./LESSON1.md) for the first lesson, [LESSON2.md](./LESSON2.md) for the second, and [PROJECT.md](./PROJECT.md) for the final project.
