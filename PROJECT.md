# Project

## Introduction

Now we have learned the basics of shell scripting with node.js we can put it to
practice and build our own command-line tools!

Specifically in this lesson your task is to build a test output formatter. A test output formatter is a program that when you pipe the results of your tests into, will read the results
of those tests and reformat them as output. We will use tape for our tests in this exercise.

A simple example of an output formatter is `tap-nyan`. To install it, create a `package.json`
using `npm init`, and run `npm install --save-dev tap-nyan`. If you call `tap-nyan` like so:

```
node test.js | tap-nyan
```

It will output something like this to the terminal:

```
13  -_-_-_-_-_-_-_,------,
0   -_-_-_-_-_-_-_|   /\_/\
0   -_-_-_-_-_-_-^|__( ^ .^)
    -_-_-_-_-_-_-  ""  ""
 Pass!
```

If you get an error message saying something like `command tap-nyan cannot be found` try running it like this instead:

```
node test.js | node_modules/.bin/tnyan
```

### What's happening here?

Something like this can be implemented using what you've already learned. The
command `node test.js` executes the test file specified and outputs the results of
the tape tests to the terminal. They look like this:

```
TAP version 13
# Description for your test
ok 1 just testing everything works
# Simple values, number, strings, booleans
ok 2 should be equal
ok 3 should be equal
ok 4 should be equal
# Complex values - objects and arrays
ok 5 should be equivalent
ok 6 should be equivalent
# Truthy and falsy
ok 7 should be truthy
ok 8 should be falsy
ok 9 should be falsy
# Async testing
ok 10 should be equal
ok 11 should be equal
# Error handling
ok 12 should throw
ok 13 should be equal

1..13
# tests 13
# pass  13

# ok
```

Using the `|` command this output then becomes the input of `tap-nyan`. Remember we
can access piped in input, as a read stream, in our node programs using the
`process.openStdin()` method.

Then all the program is doing is reading the outputs of these tests, tallying how many
pass or fail, and logging `pass!` if they all pass along with a cute ascii image.

Try making some tests fail and seeing what `tap-nyan` responds with instead:

```
12  -_-_-_-_-_-_-_,------,
1   -_-_-_-_-_-_-_|   /\_/\
0   -_-_-_-_-_-_-^|__( x .x)
    -_-_-_-_-_-_-  ""  ""
 Failed Tests: There was 1 failure

   âœ— Async testing: should be equal
```

The image changes, it tallies the number of failing tests, and lets you know which
tests failed.

### Task

Make your own output formatter! You can make it simple, like `tap-nyan`, or as complex
as you like (how about piping the results of multiple test files into it?). The
primary aim is just to have fun and be creative.

I would recommend just starting out printing two numbers to the terminal, one being how many of the
tests passed, the other how many of the tests failed. You can build on this to print
'pass!' if all tests pass and 'fail!' if any test failed. Then add-in your own styles, and features.

Clone this repo and go into the `project` folder to find an example tape test file
you can use. You'll need to create a `package.json` and install tape.

Your output formatter should be implemented like so:

```
node test.js | node output-formatter.js
```

or, if you make it executable (follow the instructions in [LESSON1.md](https://github.com/bradreeder/Node-Shell-Workshop/blob/master/LESSON1.md) to do this):

```
node test.js | output-formatter
```

The only program you need to write is `output-formatter.js`, however feel free
to modularise and write tests for the code if it becomes appropriate.

### Colours and styling

If you want to add colours and stylings to what you output to the terminal, the
manual way of doing it is to add escape sequences to your `console.log()` like so:

```javascript
console.log('\x1b[36m]', 'sometext'); // 'sometext's colour will be modified
```

The easier way to do it is to use a third-party module like `colors` or `chalk` which
abstracts this for you. Go to their github repo's to find instructions on how to use
and install them.

chalk: https://github.com/chalk/chalk

colors: https://www.npmjs.com/package/colors

### Publishing to npm

Now we have created our own command-line tool, we have in effect created our
own node module we can publish to the npm registry that others can
install and use!

Please first use the instructions in [LESSON1.md](https://github.com/bradreeder/Node-Shell-Workshop/blob/master/LESSON1.md) to make your script `node output-formatter.js` globally executable.

#### Creating a user

You can publish any directory to npm that has a `package.json`.

To publish, you must have a user on the npm registry. If you don't have one, you
can create one with the command `npm adduser`. If you created one on the npm site,
use `npm login` to store the credentials on the client.

You can use `npm config ls` to ensure that the credentials are stored on your client.
Check that it has been added to the registry by going to https://npmjs.com/~.

#### Publishing your package

*Note: The following is here for educational purposes. It's advisable to not be too frivolous in publishing to npm. If you do, be sure to provide ample documentation for your project on your repository and on npm.*

Use `npm publish` to publish the package! That's it!

Note that everything in the directory will be included unless it is ignored by a local `.gitignore` or `.npmignore` file.

Also make sure there isn't already a package with the same name, owned by somebody else.

If you want to test this has worked go to https://npmjs.com/package/<package>. You should see the information for your new package.

If you then want someone to install your new module onto their machine, try out:

```
npm install -g name-of-your-package
```
