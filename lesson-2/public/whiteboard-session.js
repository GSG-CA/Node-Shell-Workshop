// Like we spoke about last Monday, all you need to do to learn the basics of node
// and start building your own modules is to understand: callbacks, streams,
// event-emitters and modules as some basic building-blocks.


// Modules

// What's a module?

// What are the three types of modules in node?


// Callbacks

// What is a callback?

// Can you think of a few examples of when you've used a callback this week?


// Streams & Event Emitters

// I will go into a few examples here in preparation for the last workshop this week.
